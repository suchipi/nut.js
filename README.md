# Installation

## Prerequisites

This section lists runtime requirements for `nut.js` on the respective target platform.

#### Windows

In order to install `nut.js` on Windows, please make sure to have the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) installed.

In case you're running Windows 10 N, please make sure to have the [Media Feature Pack](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/media-feature-pack-for-windows-10-n-may-2020-ebbdf559-b84c-0fc2-bd51-e23c9f6a4439) installed as well.

#### macOS

On macOS, Xcode command line tools are required.
You can install them by running

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Attention**:

In case you're experiencing problems like your mouse not moving or your keyboard not typing,
please make sure to give the process you're executing your tests with accessibility permissions.

nut.js will give you a subtle hint in case permissions are lacking:

`##### WARNING! The application running this script is not a trusted process! Please visit https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js#macos #####`

When an application wants to use accessibility features, a permission pop-up should be shown.
If not, you could try to manually add the application you're running the script from.

`Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab -> Accessibility -> Add...`

For example, if you want to execute your node script in e.g. `iTerm2`, you'd have to add `iTerm.app` to the list.
When running your script from a built-in terminal in e.g. `VSCode` or `IntelliJ`, you'd have to add the respective IDE.

#### Linux

Depending on your distribution, Linux setups may differ.

In general, `nut.js` requires

- libXtst

Installation on `*buntu` distributions:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev
```

Setups on other distributions might differ.

## Install `nut.js`

Running

```bash
npm i @nut-tree/nut-js
```

or

```bash
yarn add @nut-tree/nut-js
```

### Snapshot releases

`nut.js` also provides snapshot releases which allows to test upcoming features.

```

or

```bash
yarn add @nut-tree/nut-js@next
```

will install the most recent development release of `nut.js`.

**Attention**: While snapshot releases are great to work with upcoming features before a new stable release, it is still a snapshot release.
Please bear in mind that things might change and / or break on snapshot releases, so it is not recommended using them in production.
