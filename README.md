# @suchipi/nut-js

A fork of [@nut-tree/nut-js](https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js) 2.0.0 with some of its functions modified to be synchronous:

- Keyboard functions
- Mouse functions
- Screen size functions

Because the corresponding provider interfaces for those functions have been modified, this fork won't work with external providers.

## NOTE: No longer maintained

I found out that [@nut-tree/libnut](https://github.com/nut-tree/libnut) exists, which is the underlying synchronous library that [@nut-tree/nut-js](https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js) wraps, so I no longer use this this fork.
